        <h2>Key Statistics: Deaf Individuals in Healthcare</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Communication Barriers:</strong> Deaf South Africans frequently experience difficulties communicating with healthcare professionals. Without South African Sign Language (SASL) interpreters, critical health information is often misunderstood or missed entirely, leading to inadequate care.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Interpreter Availability:</strong> Many hospitals and clinics lack on-site interpreters, especially in emergency situations. As a result, Deaf patients may rely on written notes or family members, which can compromise their privacy and understanding.</li>
            <li><strong>High Risks in Medical Situations:</strong> Miscommunication during medical consultations can lead to incorrect diagnoses, mistreatment, or failure to follow post-care instructions, endangering the lives of Deaf patients.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Accessibility Resources:</strong> Few healthcare facilities offer accessible communication tools, leaving Deaf patients at a significant disadvantage when navigating hospital settings or accessing emergency services.</li>
