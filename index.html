    <!-- Key Statistics Section -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Key Statistics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Population Impacted:</strong> Over 4 million South Africans have significant hearing loss. For many, South African Sign Language (SASL) is their primary language.</li>
            <li><strong>Education Challenges:</strong> 70% of Deaf learners in South Africa do not finish high school. Limited access to SASL-based education restricts their ability to thrive academically and professionally.</li>
            <li><strong>Employment & Healthcare Barriers:</strong> Deaf individuals experience higher unemployment rates, as most workplaces lack the tools for effective SASL communication. In healthcare, miscommunication has dire consequences, especially in critical situations.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Our Solution Section -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Our Solution</h2>
        <p>Our innovative program interprets gestures in real-time and plays them back in any South African language, allowing Deaf users to express themselves freely. It also lets hearing users communicate seamlessly by speaking in any South African language, with their words displayed as text on the screen for Deaf users. By bridging this communication gap, we make healthcare, education, and workplaces more inclusive.</p>
