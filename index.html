    <h2>Key Statistics on Deafness in South Africa</h2>
    <p>Approximately 4 million South Africans have significant hearing loss. Major barriers in healthcare, education, and employment affect accessibility for Deaf individuals.</p>

    <h3>Education Challenges</h3>
    <p>70% of South African Deaf learners do not finish high school due to limited access to SASL-based education.</p>

    <h3>Employment Obstacles</h3>
    <p>Many employers lack tools to facilitate communication in SASL, contributing to high unemployment rates among the Deaf.</p>

    <h3>Healthcare Communication Barriers</h3>
    <p>Deaf patients face risks of miscommunication, especially in emergencies where SASL interpreters are unavailable.</p>

    <h2>Project Mission</h2>
    <p>By using AI-driven interpretation, this project aims to improve accessibility in key sectors, reducing reliance on human interpreters and offering scalable solutions.</p>
